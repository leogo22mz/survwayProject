## Instructions to Start the Project

This project consists of two main parts: the backend and the frontend. Below are the steps to start each of them.

### Start the Backend

1. Open the Ubuntu terminal in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
2. Navigate to the project location and enter the backend folder using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project/survwayProject/backend
    ```
3. Start the PostgreSQL database service:

    ```bash
    sudo service postgresql start
    ```
4. Start the Rails server:

    ```bash
    rails s
    ```

### Start the Frontend

1. Open the project with an IDE, such as Visual Studio Code.
2. Open a terminal within the IDE (e.g., GitBash).
3. Navigate to the frontend folder using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project/survwayProject/frontend
    ```
4. Start the React server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Introduction and Project Origin

Survway is defined as the style we have found when developing a survey creator.

This project arises in response to the intention of creating an easy, fast, and effective tool with the aim of creating surveys, so that any type of user can enter their survey data and produce them in an aesthetic way.

## Data Model Diagram

The data models are based on a thorough analysis of information needs. See the Data Model Documentation section for additional details.

## User Requirements

We define the general requirements that make up the skeleton of our system. These will be detailed as we progress through the requirements engineering process.

## Use Cases

Here we describe the fundamental interactions with our system. For a more intuitive understanding, we include visual elements.

## Interfaces and Usability

The initial design, focused on usability, includes mockups and prototypes. After development, we provide a list with demonstrative images that apply the selected usability principles.
